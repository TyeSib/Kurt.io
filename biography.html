      Who Was Kurt Cobain? Kurt Cobain started the grunge band Nirvana in 1988
      and made the leap to a major label in 1991, signing with Geffen Records.
      Cobain also began using heroin around this time. After releasing the
      highly successful album Nevermind, Nirvana's highly acclaimed album In
      Utero was released in 1993 and catapulted to the top of the music charts.
      On April 5, 1994, in the guest house behind his Seattle home, Cobain
      committed suicide

      Nirvana Starting in 1988, Cobain's musical ambitions began moving forward.
      His band agreed on the name Nirvana and released their first track "Love
      Buzz" on a small label. Around the same time, Burckhard was replaced by
      Chad Channing on drums and the band was making headway in Seattle's music
      scene. In 1989, Nirvana released their first album, Bleach, which failed
      to make a big impression. What was evident, however, was Cobain's
      songwriting skills and what would become their hallmark blend of heavy
      metal and punk. As the band forged on, 1990 became a fateful year for
      Cobain and the rest of Nirvana. Cobain met rocker Courtney Love at a
      Portland nightclub in 1990, but their romantic relationship would develop
      later. Nirvana also got the opportunity to tour with Sonic Youth that year
      and after various changes, brought in former Scream band member Dave Grohl
      to replace Channing on drums. 'Nevermind' In 1991, Nirvana signed with a
      major label, Geffen Records, and released their second studio album,
      Nevermind, which henceforth, gave them their "grunge" label.
