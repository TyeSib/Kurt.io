    <h6>
      Kurt Donald Cobain was an American singer, songwriter, artist[1] and
      musician. He was the frontman of the rock band Nirvana, serving as the
      band's guitarist, lead vocalist, and primary songwriter. Through his
      angst-fueled songwriting and anti-establishment persona, Cobain's
      compositions widened the thematic conventions of mainstream rock music. He
      was often heralded as a spokesman of Generation X and is considered to be
      one of the most influential musicians in the history of alternative rock.
      Cobain formed the band Nirvana with Krist Novoselic and Aaron Burckhard in
      1987 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene which later
      became known as grunge. After signing with major label DGC Records,
      Nirvana found global success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit" from their
      critically acclaimed second album Nevermind. Although Cobain was hailed as
      the voice of his generation following Nirvana's sudden success, he
      resented this, believing his message and artistic vision had been
      misinterpreted by the public.
